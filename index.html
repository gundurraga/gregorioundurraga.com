      content="Gregorio Undurraga is a Chilean oil painter, born in August 1993 in Santiago. After working as an environmental civil engineer, he decided in 2021 to dedicate his life entirely to painting. In 2022, he moved to France to study the painting of the human figure and settled in the historic city of Arles. He exhibited for the first time in this city and had the opportunity to develop his personal style by experimenting with different techniques. Currently, his figurative and monochromatic paintings reflect on the relationship between society and nature."
